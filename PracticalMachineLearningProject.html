<h1>Practical Machine Learning Project</h1>
<h2>Prediction Assignment</h2>
<h3>Rationale</h3>
<p>Using devices such as Jawbone Up, Nike FuelBand, and Fitbit it is now possible to collect a large amount of data 
about personal activity relatively inexpensively. These type of devices are part of the quantified self movement &#45 
a group of enthusiasts who take measurements about themselves regularly to improve their health, to find patterns in 
their behavior, or because they are tech geeks. One thing that people regularly do is quantify how much of a particular 
activity they do, but they rarely quantify how well they do it. In this project, your goal will be to use data from accelerometers 
on the belt, forearm, arm, and dumbell of 6 participants. They were asked to perform barbell lifts correctly and incorrectly in 5 
different ways. More information is available from the website here:

 (see the section on the Weight Lifting Exercise Dataset).</p>

<h3>Data Preparation</h3>
<p> The data is divided in to training data and test data. The training data consists of 19622 observations of 160 variables. The variable we want to predict is the "classe" variable,
which is the way in which the barbell movement was performed. This variable can have 5 values: "A", "B", "C", "D", "E". The training data contained several variables with missing values 
that were removed to allow an efficient implementation of the machine learning algorithms. After this operation, there were 53 variables to use as prediction features. </p>

<h3>Data Fitting</h3>
<p> Due to memory limitations the complete training set could not be used to train the Random Forest algorithm. A subset (p=0.5) of the original training set was used to train 
the Random Forest model with k-fold cross-validation (using 5 folds). The results of the training step were:

  <code>
               Type of random forest: classification
                     Number of trees: 500
No. of variables tried at each split: 27

        OOB estimate of  error rate: 1.15%
